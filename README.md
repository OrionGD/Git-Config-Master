## 📌 Overview

**Git Config Master** is a high-fidelity, interactive educational platform designed to bridge the gap between **abstract version control concepts** and **professional command-line execution**.

It features a **state-aware terminal simulator**, **architectural visualizations**, and **guided lifecycle workflows**, enabling learners to understand not just *what* Git commands do, but *how* they affect the underlying configuration architecture.

Unlike static tutorials, Git Config Master provides immediate, visual feedback on configuration scope, identity resolution, and workflow state.

## ✨ Features

* **⌨️ Orion-OS Simulator**
  A risk-free, state-aware terminal environment that accurately mocks real Git Bash behavior.

* **🌀 Full Lifecycle Flow (S-A-C-P)**
  Step-by-step end-to-end procedure from local initialization to GitHub deployment:

  * Status
  * Add
  * Commit
  * Push

* **📊 Architectural Visualization**
  High-fidelity breakdown of Git configuration scopes:

  * Local
  * Global
  * System

* **🌗 Adaptive Theming**
  Seamless dark/light mode transitions with a technical, high-contrast aesthetic.

* **📱 Fully Responsive Layout**
  Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing using a “Mission Control” interface.

---

## 🧠 Learning Model

Git Config Master is built around **guided training protocols**, not isolated commands:

* Visualizes **scope precedence and override behavior**
* Reinforces **identity management** (`user.name`, `user.email`)
* Demonstrates **real-world team synchronization scenarios**
* Encourages safe experimentation without affecting real repositories

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React 19 (ES Modules)
* **Language**: TypeScript
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
* **Design System**:
  Glassmorphism, CSS transitions, and high-performance keyframe animations
* **Deployment**: Vercel (optimized, low-latency builds)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply open the application to enter the **Mission Control Dashboard**.

### How to Use

1. **Initialize Dashboard**
   Launch the app to enter the training environment.

2. **Follow Protocols**
   Navigate through modules such as:

   * Full Lifecycle Flow
   * Workflow Essentials

3. **Practice in Sandbox**
   Execute commands safely in the integrated terminal, for example:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```

All commands update the system’s active state visualization in real time.
